def activation_equivalent_path(path: str | None = None, *, scripts_dir: str | None = None) -> str:
    """Returns ``PATH`` with this environment's scripts directory prepended.

    Prepending the environment's scripts directory (``sysconfig.get_path("scripts")`` —
    the venv's ``bin/``, or ``Scripts\\`` on Windows) is exactly what ``source
    .../activate`` does to ``PATH``. Building that same view explicitly means
    subprocesses resolve console scripts identically whether or not the caller
    activated the environment, without inventing any resolution order beyond the
    standard, documented one.

    Args:
        path: The ``PATH`` value to prepend to. Defaults to ``os.environ["PATH"]``.
        scripts_dir: Override of the scripts directory (for tests). Defaults to
            ``sysconfig.get_path("scripts")``.

    Returns:
        ``scripts_dir`` followed by the entries of ``path``, minus any duplicate
        occurrence of ``scripts_dir`` and any empty entries (a leading/trailing
        separator would otherwise mean "current directory" on POSIX).

    Examples:
        >>> activation_equivalent_path("/usr/bin", scripts_dir="/my/venv/bin")
        '/my/venv/bin:/usr/bin'

        Idempotent — an already-activated ``PATH`` is not double-prepended:

        >>> activation_equivalent_path("/my/venv/bin:/usr/bin", scripts_dir="/my/venv/bin")
        '/my/venv/bin:/usr/bin'

        An empty ``PATH`` yields just the scripts directory:

        >>> activation_equivalent_path("", scripts_dir="/my/venv/bin")
        '/my/venv/bin'

def resolve_console_script(name: str, *, scripts_dir: str | None = None) -> str:
    """Resolves console script ``name`` exactly as an activated environment would.

    ``subprocess.run([name, ...])`` resolves via the ambient ``PATH``, which omits this
    environment's scripts directory unless the user activated the venv — so running the
    bundled ``MEDS_extract-eICU`` by its venv path (cron jobs, Slurm scripts, Makefiles)
    would otherwise die with ``FileNotFoundError`` on this subprocess even though the
    script is installed right beside the interpreter. Resolving with ``shutil.which``
    against the activation-equivalent ``PATH`` gives the same result activation would,
    with real executable semantics (exec-bit checks on POSIX, ``PATHEXT`` on Windows)
    rather than bespoke file probing.

    Args:
        name: The console script's basename (e.g. ``"MEDS_transform-pipeline"``).
        scripts_dir: Override of the scripts directory (for tests).

    Returns:
        Absolute path to the executable.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the script is neither in the scripts directory nor on
            ``PATH``.

    Examples:
        Console scripts installed in this environment resolve without activation:

        >>> from pathlib import Path
        >>> import sysconfig
        >>> exe = resolve_console_script("MEDS_transform-pipeline")
        >>> Path(exe).parent == Path(sysconfig.get_path("scripts"))
        True

        Tools installed elsewhere still resolve through the ambient ``PATH``:

        >>> resolve_console_script("ls")  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        '/.../ls'

        Missing scripts raise with a message naming both lookup locations:

        >>> resolve_console_script("definitely-not-a-real-script-xyz")

    The value comes from Hydra and may be `None` (`download_workers: null` in YAML
    behaves like an unset key, yielding `default`). `bool` is rejected explicitly
